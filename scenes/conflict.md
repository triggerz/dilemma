# Description

For the last couple of weeks you have been experiencing some bad vibes in your team, with people snapping at each other.  

You have been asking around, and your employees confirm your suspicion. It seems to be narrowing down to chemistry issues between Cathrin and John. 

Individually they both function well. But when they are on the same shift the atmosphere becomes intolerable. 

You have had individual talks with both John and Cathrin. After a thorough analysis of the options, the conclusion is clear: You need to relocate John to another team.
