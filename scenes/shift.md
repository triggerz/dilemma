# Description
There is a flu going round, and you just received a message that Joan will not be coming in tomorrow morning. 

If you cannot find a replacement, the monthly targets are in risk of not being met, as the lack of the extra set of hands is likely to slow things down. 

But: You have already asked around, and no-one wants to take the shift. 

There is no way around it: You have to go back and ask one who have already turned you down the first time you asked. 

Who will you contact next?

# Choice
Lilly? When you her asked the first time, she answered that she had already taken on two extra shifts in the past 3 weeks, so she did not want to take another one! (but you have a sense that you could talk her into itâ€¦)
